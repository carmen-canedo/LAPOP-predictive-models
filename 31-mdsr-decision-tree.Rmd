# Structure
Working to make a decision tree for the Bolivian data.

```{r}
library(mdsr)
```

# Separating into Testing and Training
I will have a sample of 80% of the rows as the training dataset, and 20% for the testing dataset.

```{r}
#Setting the seed
set.seed(364)

#Getting the number of rows
n <- nrow(labelled_wide)
#Getting .2 of `labelled_wide`
test <- sample.int(n, size = round(0.2 * n))
#Making training dataset
train <- labelled_wide[-test, ]
#Checking length
nrow(train)

#Making testing dataset
test <- labelled_wide[test, ]
#Checking length
nrow(test)

#Making sure the training and testing datasets add up to `labelled_wide`
nrow(labelled_wide)
nrow(train) + nrow(test)
```

```{r}
tally(~ ideology, data = train, format = "percent")
```

I am going to try to find a split for ideology based on one variable first, urban vs. rural.

```{r}
library(rpart)
```

```{r}
rpart(ideology ~ urbano_rural, data = train)
```

# !DO NOT USE REFERENCE ONLY
# ```{r}
# ggplot(data = train, aes(x = urbano_rural, y = ideology)) +
#   geom_count(aes(color = urbano_rural),
# position = position_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.1), alpha = 0.5)
# ```

```{r}

```
