# Getting Data into your H2O Cluster

Here is the process for [uploading a file](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-yau/5/docs-website/h2o-docs/data-munging/uploading-data.html) and [importing a file](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-yau/5/docs-website/h2o-docs/data-munging/importing-data.html).

I will just be uploading a file in this case, as this is what I will need to be doing for most of the LAPOP datasets.

```{r}
bolivia_path <- "142790203Bolivia LAPOP AmericasBarometer 2017 V1.0_W.dta"

boliva_2017 <- h2o.uploadFile(path = bolivia_path, destination_frame = "bolivia_2017")
```
