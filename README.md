# LAPOP-predictive-models
Using predictive machine learning models to uncover factors within the LAPOP datasets as part of my independent study in CS 3860, Undergraduate Research.

## Goals
Due to the resignation of the Bolivian president, Evo Morales, in October, I am interested in determining the typical supporters of his party, **Movimiento al Socialismo** (MAS), and how participants' support has changed over the past 14 years. In my project, I hope to develop a predictive model that uncovers factors associated with participantâ€™s perception of Evo Morales and satisfaction with the Bolivian government. 

I am also going to use these models to provide a risk-adjusted measure of perception to directly answer whether residents in Bolivia feel more or less satisfied with Morales' administration than expected. I will then discern other factors that might be driving these perceptions that may not be accounted for in the survey data, and hypothesize how factors might be identified if the model predictions improve with the inclusion of new data.
