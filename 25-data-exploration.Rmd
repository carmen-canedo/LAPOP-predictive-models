# Structure
I am now going to explore the tidy version of the 2004-2018 Bolivia data to find factors that influence my question: who is likely to support the MAS party moving forward?

## Reading through questions
Familiarizing myself with the questions asked, so I might understand what questions and factors could be relevant using `tabyl()`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
bolivia_clean %>% 
  tabyl(question_es) %>% 
  select(question_es)
```
